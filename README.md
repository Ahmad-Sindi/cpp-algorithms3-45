# Algorithm Challenge #45 – Convert Record to Line (Level 3)

🧠 Problem Description  
-
This program reads bank client information as a structured record  
and converts it into a single text line using a custom separator.

This format is commonly used when saving records to text files
or transmitting data in a simple serialized form.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Modeling real-world data using structs
- Collecting structured user input
- Converting numeric data to strings
- Serializing records into a flat text format
- Preparing data for file storage or persistence

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**  
Account Number: 12345  
Pin Code: 7788  
Name: Your Name  
Phone: 0123456789  
Balance: 15000  

**Output:**  
12345#//#7788#//#Your Name#//#0551234567#//#15000
